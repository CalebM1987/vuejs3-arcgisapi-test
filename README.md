 Demo app showing how ArcGIS JS API seems to not play well with VueJS 3.x when JS API objects (e.g. FeatureLayers, MapViews) are set to reactive objects in the VueJS ecosystem.  
 I'm unsure why exactly this is happening but assume it has to do with Esri's Accessor not playing well with JavaScript Proxy objects, on which VueJS 3.0 has based all reactive objects.
